# Browser-Scroller Project

**Browser Scroller** is an open-source browser extension designed to provide a seamless, infinite browsing experience. Instead of reaching the end of a webpage and having to manually navigate up, this extension automatically reloads the content from the top once the user scrolls to the bottom.


## Why Use This?

* Enhanced reading experience without the need to manually scroll back up when reviewing long webpages repeatedly.

* Reference and study material for reviewing/cycling content multiple times, like documentation, study guides, or certain papers.

* Can be adapted to work for display screens: ideal for schedules, announcements, dashboards, or advertisements that need to continuously repeat content without restarting the system.

This repository is a simple extension made to learn and practice setting up our first open-source project.


## How To Use The "Browser-Scroller" Extension

To get started, clone the project reposistory for the extension.

To install the extension, open the [about:debugging](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/about_colon_debugging/index.html) page in Firefox. Click the "This Firefox" option on the left hand side. Then, click the "Load Temporary Add-on..." button and select any file in your extension's directory. 

The extension now installs and remains installed until you restart Firefox. 

To use, click on the extensions button on the top right corner of the browser. Click on the "Browser Scroller" button. A popup box with a toggle feature should appear. Use the slider to activate/de-activate the extension.
