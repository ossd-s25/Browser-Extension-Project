# Browser-Scroller Project

**Browser Scroller** is an open-source browser extension designed to provide a seamless, infinite browsing experience. Instead of reaching the end of a webpage and having to manually navigate up, this extension automatically reloads the content from the top once the user scrolls to the bottom.


## Why Use This?

Browser-Scroller is ideal for a variety of scenarios:

- **Enhanced Reading Experience**: Keep your focus on long articles or webpages without interruptions by automatically reloads content as you reach the end.
  
- **Study Material Review**: Perfect for reviewing content like documentation, study guides, or papers, as it allows you to cycle through material repeatedly.

- **Display for Continuous Content**: Adapt the extension for use on display screens for schedules, announcements, dashboards, or advertisements that need to keep repeating content without restarting the system.

This project is a simple browser extension built for learning and practicing open-source contributions.


## Features

- Infinite scrolling: automatically reloads content when reaching the bottom of the page.
- Toggle On/Off: enable or disable the extension with a simple toggle button.
- Lightweight and minimalistic design.
