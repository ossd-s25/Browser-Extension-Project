# Browser-Scroller Project

This is an open-source browser extension project. It simply modifies the behavior of the browser by reloading content from the top of the page once the user scrolls to the bottom of the browser. 

This repository is for a simple extension made to learn and practice setting up our first open-source project.

Need help scrolling through websites? Finding the task a bit too tedious? Well look no further because **Browser Scroller** is here to solve your problems.


## How to use the "Browser-Scroller" extension

To install, open the [about:debugging](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/about_colon_debugging/index.html) page in Firefox. Click the "This Firefox" option on the left hand side. Then, click the "Load Temporary Add-on..." button and select any file in your extension's directory. 

The extension now installs and remains installed until you restart Firefox. 

To use, click on the extensions button on the top right corner of the browser. Click on the "Browser Scroller" button. A popup box with a toggle feature should appear. Use the slider to activate/de-activate the extension.

As of now, only works for .com domains
